Some images of my plot.  I have three raised beds, specifically for growing food.

I have a number of flower beds that I use for growing edible fruit,veg and herbs - I've tried to have all of the plants I introduced edible, but a couple of nice non-edible plants have made the cut! 

This is the little herb patch I have: here I grow chives, sage, rosemary, marjoram and parsley.  I also put in nasturtiums and thyme in over the summer.

In the back garden, right by the kitchen doors I also have chives, spring onions, strawberries and nasturtiums.

I also have this empty plot which I use for growing courgettes and other things that need sunlight for growing.  The back garden is partially shaded, so I have been trying to grow sun-dependent fruits out here.

This is my little greenhouse.  I love it so much.  It does a great job for seed germination and growing young plants inside before the summer really takes off.

There are the many fruit bushes I planted in spring 2017 - they are looking great now.  Here's to all the raspberries I will be gorging on in the future.
