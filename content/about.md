Welcome to my gardening blog!  I am writing this blog to document my experiments with growing fruit and vegetables in my garden.  I completed my PhD in September 2017 and I am keen to nurture my love of plants!  I have been growing edibles for around 4 years.  I bought a house in 2015 with my partner and since then I'vee been transforming the garden into one big edible garden.  The vision is to have as many plants as possible that are edible in the garden.  I've experimented growing what have been described as "unusual" varieties, and this year I want to start documenting my successess (and failures).  I also have small greenhouse.  I noticed that it gets very hot in the summer (>40 degrees C), so I have bought a temperature and humidity sensor and I'm going to track the change in temperature over the day and the summer months to see how high it really gets.
