## Plans

I've been beavering away at getting plants sorted and making plans for this year. I've already ordered some seed potatoes online (patchseedpotatoes.co.uk), from the motherland (N. Ireland). I'm quite excited because they are unusual varieties: 
- purple rain: second early. It has purple skin and flesh. I tried similar from Lidl last year and they were delicious and weird looking on the plate.

- Highland Burgundy red: this potato has red flesh, hailing from Scotland. Downside: main crop, which means long growth season. 
- pink fir apple: supposedly nutty in flavour. I chose them for their strange shape: they look a bit like an oca (new Zealand yams). They are also first earlies, so I should have a steady supply of potatoes if all other crops fail. 
They are yet to be dispatched, but I will update with photos upon arrival. 

Exciting news: I've put my name down for an allotment and I'm next on the waiting list. Liv thinks this is a terrible idea; she'd rather I dug up some of the front garden and used that. I've said it will be an eye sore, but I'm very tempted. The debate continues. Let's see how long the waiting list is. If I do get one, I will grow all of the potatoes there since they're so beastly when they grow.

I've also purchased 2 all gold raspberry canes, 2 Tulameen raspberry, 2 blackberry (thornless and) and a fairly mature gooseberry (whinham's Industry). The gold raspberry I bought died last year so I want to ensure success this year. I've also got another honey Berry to join my other one from last year, since they fruit better in pairs. Though the fruit wasn't very nice - I'm a sucker for a £2 plant from Morrisons. 

I'm also keen on buying some nut trees this year. I'm thinking two will do. Probably cob nuts because they tend to have self fertile. I do have a walnut from last year, but the more the merrier! 

I've also found that the cocktail kiwi has a female friend, of a similar size and is just as hardy. They need to be pollinated, so aren't fertile but luckily, the variety I have (Issai) will pollinate it, it has red flesh and skin and is called Ken's red. Its quite pricey at £25 for a 5 litre tub (

I'm tempted, but might be a next year job as I currently have a lot of trees to contend with (2 x apple, 1 x pear, 1 x plum, 2 x cherry, 1 x walnut, 2 x fig, 1 x nectarine, 1 x Bay tree, 1 x Chilean guava (more of a shrub)). May have to be a birthday present or something, as I need to buy my nut trees and I'll probably buy some more cherry trees. Yes, I'm crazy. 

I've also bought an asparagus crown again. I did last year, but the slugs ate it. I'm going to start this off in a pot and move when it's got something to fight back with. 

These are 2019 purchases so far- it's safe to say, this is not the end.



## Growing

I have started growing some things, mostly because it is quite mild still and also because I want to grow some onions and garlic.  I usually leave it far too late and miss the cold spell needed for garlic; that or the slugs eat them.  This year I have a cunning plan, that is I've planted them in pots inside the greenhouse.  As it is not a heated greenhouse, this should be fine.  It can get fairly chilly in there. I may have to reinstate the raspberry Pi to hep monitor temperatures.  I've planted 12 red onions from sets and 11 garlic cloves.  They have gone into the newly clean and scrubbed greenhouse!

I also potted up the asparagus crown which I intend to move to its final position when it is a bit warmer and I know what I'm actually doing.

Bring on the seeds purchase, who needs money when you have plants?!
