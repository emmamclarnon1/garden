The plants in the greenhouse are growing now.  It's still quite chilly here, but I'm hoping it will heat up soon. 

I've sown more seeds for the garlic chives because the ones I sowed a couple of weeks ago have not germinated.  The old g. chives were from Poundworld and I've never been able to germinate them before.  I've ordered a new batch from www.seekay.co.uk for 99p.  I will update the status on their growth as time goes on.  I usually get seeds from seekay or https://www.premierseedsdirect.com/ or Poundland/ Poundworld.

I've also decided to give hamburg parsley another shot this year.  I tried last year, but I over-sowed too many brassica seeds beside them and they died due to lack of light.  I've sown these seeds into a pot in the greenhouse and they require light for germination.  Some seeds have started germinating already.  They grow into parsley ontop and a parsnip-like root. 

I've also sown some alpine strawberries - I grew them a few years ago into a hanging basket and they were delicious but were attacked by aphids.  I didn't grow them last year, but fancy trying them again this year.  I've read they are perennial so I will put them into the ground, maybe where the herbs are at the front of the house.  

I bought 6 chilli plants today from B & Q: I didn't get around to germinating the seed in Jan and after many failed attempted recently, I figured there would be no point in growing from seed since it's now May.  I got 2 x Jalapeno, 2 x paper lantern chillis and 2 x Thai red dragon chilli plants.  Some already have some flower buds so I will try to keep them over winter if they survive because they actually are perennials, but seem to be grown as annuals in the UK due to the cold tempertures. 

###Chilli seed experiement

I've started my chilli seed experiment on the best germination technique.  I've read that sanding seed coats or nicking a bit off the seed coat (scarification) speeds up germination, and I've had success previously with courgette seeds.  I haven't ever tested which method is best: soaking seeds, sanding or or nicking the coats.  So I've set up an experiment to test this:

I've put 3 x Thai chilli seeds in each treatment and also 2 x patio chillis for each treatment (I didn't have 9 for patio chillis, hence doing Thai chillis too).  I've put each ramekin in a clear plastic bag to maintain heat and humidity levels.
