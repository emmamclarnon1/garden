## 2019 recap

Hi all, it's been a long time since I've blogged.  I have been very busy with the allotment and garden :) It's been a very productive year and I am loving my allotment!

In 2019 I successfully managed to grow loads of funny coloured potatoes, onions, cabbages, chillies, tomatilloes, asparagus, raspberries, strawberries and loads of other things that were all equally yummy.   I grew way too many courgettes and broad beans! The glut was real; I'd never had a glut before, but now I will never grow too many courgette plants as the stress of trying to use them all is so stressful!

I had lots or raspberries, blackberries and other kinds of berries this year! Finally seeing the fruits of my labour - quite exciting.  Though one minor concern is that the raspberries keep coming up through the lawn...

I grw pumpkins for the first time too (foot for scale).  It was a the variety "Crown Prince" - silver/ blue skinned fruits.  Very tasty too.

My courgette/ squash glut came from growing round courgettes, regular green courgettes (variety "black beauty"),red kuri and patty pan.  All delicious; but I grew too many!  I had about 4/ 5 times this amount!

And a few monster sized ones...

I also grew some sweetheart cabbages, I had forgotten about them, but they just appeared and I was chuffed with myself:

### 2019 Winter

Currently I have sprouts (red and green), purple sprouting broccoli and leeks in the ground.  I grew the sprouts too early and they have very loose leaves filled with slugs and all sorts.  Lesson learned for next year!

I'm looking forward to getting rid of everything and starting again once I harvest my last potatoes and sprouts.  The apple fir ones were bloody delicious I might add; the red fleshed ones made interesting mash and the purple rain ones are still in the ground as the asparagus is yet to fully die back so I can't get to them!

I'm planning on having on soft fruit bed for all my raspberries, strawberries and other fruits.  Then 2 for the rest of the food.  I will plan everything better next year, honest!
