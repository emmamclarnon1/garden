<p>It’s been a while, but rest assured I’ve been beavering away in the garden and at the allotment.</p>

<h3>Sowing/ Planting</h3>
<p>I had soaked some seeds for germination a couple of weeks ago, but I accidentally dropped the box and now I have no idea what is what. Doh! There were courgettes, squash, cucumber, sweetcorn and cucamelon. I potted them up anyway and tried to guess the labels. May be time to start again. They also haven’t germinated very well, so I think it’s a sign to start over.</p>
<p>I ordered some new seeds, which I’m excited to grow: - Cucumber white wonder - Gherkin national - Pea douce provance - Courgette Tondo Chiaro di Nizza - Radish watermelon - Dwarf French Bean Borlotto - Lingua Di Fuoco - Sweetcorn F1 Earlibird</p>
<p>I want to get some more seed for sorrel and other herbs to add to the herb patch.</p>

<h3>Garden</h3>
<p>My planters are looking adorable now the daffodils have come through and the Russian sage is coming out of dormancy. I’ve planted oxalis, Dahlias and sparaxis outside. We’ve had a couple of cold snaps of about 1 degrees, so I may end up with nothing, but I thought I’d chance it. Let’s see what happens.</p>

<p>I added some new plants to the top bed I’m trying to get the corner plot into some sort of shape. I’ve put some primroses, violas, calendula, cineraria and we got a very special hellebore called ‘Emma’. There’s also loganberry, gooseberry and jostaberry up there with some lavender and chives, but it is such a beast I’m going to have to put way more plants in. I’m looking for ground over and to make it look really nice. It’s a work in progress for now, but watch this space. It will be a lush border area in no time. Some thoughts are rudbeckia, saliva hotlips and some other nice colourful plants.</p>

<h3>Allotment</h3>
<p>The allotment is a gift that keeps on giving! All of the asparagus spears are coming through, which is pretty exciting given that I had to out zero effort in.</p>
<p>I put in 3 rows of potatoes. One row of purple rain, one row of pink fir apple and one row of Maris Piper. The rows took about 13 seed potatoes spaced around 30cm apart and 60cm row spacing. I dug them about 6 inches deep - or what I thought was 6 inches; upon consulting the tape measure it’s more like 10/12 inches. Opps! I’m really bad at guessing size and so I just dug and hoped for the best. I found some old potatoes in the rows and at that depth meaning that I’m sort of right. Bad thing is that I chose the wrong plot for the potatoes - you aren’t supposed to grow them year after year (due to diseases building up) , but I’d already done a row before I came across some. Damn. I’ve left them for now but will take my punishment of blight if it doesn’t work out.</p>

<p>I also planted some of the peas, radishes and broad beans I’d started off in the greenhouse up into their positions too. The garlic is growing very well, I may need to take off the polytunnel soon, they are growing so big! The onions are too, but they are lagging slightly behind.</p>
<p>I spread some chicken manure pellets onto the plot in an attempt to feed it; I was going to use manure, but I met a man there who said it took ages to breakdown, so I thought I’d probably left it too late and will do this in winter next year instead.</p>

<h3>Greenhouse</h3>
<p>I’ve decided to bite the bullet and buy a heated propagator. The chilies, tomatoes and aubergines aren’t growing very well in the greenhouse. I know that’s because it has been quite cold still and I moved them out too soon. But I had had enough of the mess they made and was running out of space in the house. This way, I’ll start them off until they get to a decent 10-15cm and then move them outside to the greenhouse, it should at least speed things up. It was only £25 from Amazon and is 52cm, so I’m hoping I can squeeze a few plants in there.</p>
<p>I’ve had a clear out again; the greenhouse was such a mess again! I managed to find a use for the beast of the 50cm diameter pot. I put the 2 vaccinium blueberries (unknown sp.) into this pot with some lovely new ericacious compost; it was Bullrush compost and really good quality. I intend to buy some more of this compost as it is really good quality, until the other stuff I buy from Homebase (J. Arthur Bowers multipurpose compost); it has so many big chunks and lots of bark and wood in it.</p>

<p>The cuttings I took seem to be growing well for the most part; I’ve moved them outside because they are looking a bit gross with mites on them. I don’t want to move them because I think this might break any delicate roots they’ve made, but I’ll have to soon.</p>
<p>Most plants in the greenhouse have been moved to the allotment, but I have my courgette/ squash/ cucumber/ sweetcorn ensemble growing there. Hopefully they will start to pop up and I can move them to the allotment soon. I’ve used 2 out of the 3 beds now, so there’s only one left!</p>
<p>I’ll be back to report on how the propagator is going.</p>
