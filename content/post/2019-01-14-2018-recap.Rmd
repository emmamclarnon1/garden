So I'm back - I have been altogether rubbish at keeping it updated in the summer.  Too much fun was had between entering a new decade of my life, graduating (finally, I can use my Dr title and revive all those dying plants) and drinking lots of beer.  There was also some gardening too.

I finally made some wins in the garden: I successfully grew cucamelons and chillies!  I know I didn't grow the chillies from seed, but I'm taking it as a massive win!  We got three bowls full of them (see below).  

The summer was very hot, so my insect problems were largely due to aphids, butterflies lying eggs and caterpillars.  Yes, I have heard of insect-proof mesh and yes, 2019 will be none of these problems! (That is quite ambitious, but you have to dream a little).

My first sweet success came in the form of mini cucumbers! The things I have been trying for years and failing at, apparently need something to climb up and a lot of sun.  I had a fairly decent crop of these bad boys.  Worth the years of disappointment?  Hell no! Will I grow them again?  Always! Well, I'll at least try.

Root parsley was delicious in a roast dinner, a little like parsnip, but nicer.  I will probably grow these agin, but maybe not in a pot as I think this restricted the growth.

I also got a couple of cocktail kiwis:

It was a crazy warm summer, so the chillies were loving the heat Had so many I had to dry a few of them and also just give loads away. My first chilli glut.

My main reason for not updating the blog was due to my laziness for uploading pictures.  I got a decent camera for my birthday, so I am ready to be more bloggy in 2019 and take more photos.  I will also stop being so lazy.  I spent a lot of tonight trying to code in a HTML image carousel, but having failed that I gave up. I went on a web development course (big up Code First: Girls) and now I wish I'd written this site in just HTML so I can control more elements and make it better.  Challenge of 2019: add image gallery and maybe make own Hugo theme.

I took everything from the greenhouse outside and gave it a good clean inside and outside. It's looking pretty shiny (well, it was in the dark - may not be when I look at it tomorrow).  I can't wait for more sunlight!  It is looking pretty organised now.  I'm also enlisting Liv's DIY services to build more shelves so I can utilise it better this year.

We trawled around 3 garden centers at the weekend and I bought lots of plants (yes, I know I'm a bit early, but it's relatively mild and I'm excited by the extra ten minutes of day light we get).


I will be back later in the week with an update for my 2019 plans - let's just say they are **nuts**.
