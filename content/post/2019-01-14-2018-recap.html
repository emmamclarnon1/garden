<p>So I’m back - I have been altogether rubbish at keeping it updated in the summer. Too much fun was had between entering a new decade of my life, graduating (finally, I can use my Dr title and revive all those dying plants) and drinking lots of beer. There was also some gardening too.</p>
<p>I finally made some wins in the garden: I successfully grew cucamelons and chillies! I know I didn’t grow the chillies from seed, but I’m taking it as a massive win! We got three bowls full of them (see below).</p>
<p>The summer was very hot, so my insect problems were largely due to aphids, butterflies lying eggs and caterpillars. Yes, I have heard of insect-proof mesh and yes, 2019 will be none of these problems! (That is quite ambitious, but you have to dream a little).</p>

<p>My first sweet success came in the form of mini cucumbers! The things I have been trying for years and failing at, apparently need something to climb up and a lot of sun. I had a fairly decent crop of these bad boys. Worth the years of disappointment? Hell no! Will I grow them again? Always! Well, I’ll at least try.</p>

<p>Root parsley was delicious in a roast dinner, a little like parsnip, but nicer. I will probably grow these agin, but maybe not in a pot as I think this restricted the growth.</p>

<p>It was a crazy warm summer, so the chillies were loving the heat Had so many I had to dry a few of them and also just give loads away. My first chilli glut.</p>

<p>My main reason for not updating the blog was due to my laziness for uploading pictures. I got a decent camera for my birthday, so I am ready to be more bloggy in 2019 and take more photos. I will also stop being so lazy. I spent a lot of tonight trying to code in a HTML image carousel, but having failed that I gave up. I went on a web development course (big up Code First: Girls) and now I wish I’d written this site in just HTML so I can control more elements and make it better. Challenge of 2019: add image gallery and maybe make own Hugo theme.</p>
<p>I took everything from the greenhouse outside and gave it a good clean inside and outside. It’s looking pretty shiny (well, it was in the dark - may not be when I look at it tomorrow). I can’t wait for more sunlight! It is looking pretty organised now. I’m also enlisting Liv’s DIY services to build more shelves so I can utilise it better this year.</p>
<p>We trawled around 3 garden centers at the weekend and I bought lots of plants (yes, I know I’m a bit early, but it’s relatively mild and I’m excited by the extra ten minutes of day light we get).</p>
<p>I will be back later in the week with an update for my 2019 plans - let’s just say they are <strong>nuts</strong>.</p>
