Hello. It's been quite frosty recently, so I've been sowing seeds inside and making a complete mess with perlite.

A few years ago, we had a terrible infestation with compost gnats when I reported a dragon tree, so I wanted to avoid that again this year. My bright idea was to buy loads of perlite and start the chillies and tomatoes off inside. I used this during my PhD very briefly and it was grand. It is supposedly inert, but there are some nutrients in it that plants are able to extract: I grew some grass seeds with nothing but ultra pure water and they had a lot of silicon and were not as nutrient deficient as I expected. I will be supplementing them with very weak liquid feed, as the nutrients can be too concentrated and burn the plants.

Apart from water everywhere and accidentally knocking pots of perlite from windowsills, most of the seeds are going well. I've got some marigolds, tomatoes, chillies, spring onions, leeks, aubergines, corn, peas and cabbage seeds all sprouting. I'm concerned about where I'll put them once they start growing bigger. But that will take a few weeks or more, then I'll be able to move them to the greenhouse hopefully.

Added to the above, I've also started to germinate some more seeds for the companion planting and for my planters. I have four of them! I've got them filled with some hyacinths, primroses and tulips. I also got two Russian sage plants for Â£1 from homebase (Perovskia), they were in the bargain bucket so I'm hoping they spring back to life after winter. I sowed some sweet peas, marigolds and some nasturtiums.

The planter below has some thyme I grew last year that's managed to last the winter.

I'm almost ready to move the onions and garlic to the allotment.

I have been quite busy the past two weekends, so haven't been able to recently. I got a polytunnel for them, to protect from the birds until they grow a bit. I took the plunge and got some elephant garlic as well, which I'll move there too. I've read that if you don't harvest it the first year, it will divide because it's a perennial.  I'll give that a bash!

I'm nervous about my allotment when I think of the size of it, but I reckon I'll be able to fill it with lots of goodies. I'll use the raised beds at home for my soft fruit and salads. My potatoes are chitting along nicely, though I'm wondering if I need to buy more seed potatoes to get a decent crop to last all summer. I probably will because I am a slave to growing stuff ha! It's all good fun, and it keeps me out of mischief for now!

I've put the trees outside and am eagerly awaiting the arrival of my two hazelnut trees! They are partially self fertile, so I'm hoping two of the same variety will grow okay. I've read online that two trees of the same variety are fine, but then other websites say you need different varieties. I'll have to buy another one in the future if there's no joy. They are 5ft and 3 years old. I'm not sure whether to put them into the ground or into pots. I've bought 55cm diameter pots for them, but I'm not sure. I'll have to see what they look like. **Update** They have arrived. They are smaller than advertised and only 2 years old, rather than 3 which is annoying.

I'm looking forward to the better weather, when I can start using the greenhouse and get sowing stuff outside. For now, it's perlite and patience.

Until next time.
