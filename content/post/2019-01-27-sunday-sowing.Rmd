### Allotment news

I've been up to the allotment this weekend and managed to clear away most of the remaining plants left by the previous owner.  I now have a mostly cleared plot.  Just some more weeding to do before it is totally clear, but I hoed all of the beds, so I'm hoping the frost will nip them dead so I don't have to.  There are some Calendula (AKA English marigold) there, which I intend to keep.  These plants are very good companion plants because of the colour - it's good for attracting pollinators.

I also put some tarp down so the ground doesn't freeze over, as we are expecting some chilly nights over the next week or so.  I am hoping to move the garlic and onions that I've put into modules in the greenhouse over to the allotment soon.  Though, I will need some protection from pesky birds - they always seem to peck them out of the ground.  But I know just the lady for the job...

We've had to put a sleeper onto one of the beds, as the wood was missing.

Next weekend I will be ready to plant the garlic and onions over there, provided the weather isn't too chilly and I am able to make or buy a contraption to keep the pesky birds at bay. The guy who showed me around said his garlic usually gets munched by mice, so perhaps it is a risk but I'll see how the weather is.

I usually plant spring onion ends into a little patch out side the kitchen, but I have some more so I will put those into the allotment to start things off.

### Plants and sowing

I have sown quite a few seeds; well I've started them off indoors (read more detail [here](https://gardenr.netlify.com/plants-2019/)).  I usually germinate on paper towel and then transplant to pots.  It can be a bit of a pain because I'm lazy, but it's worth it to see which seeds are viable.  I've mainly started off the seeds that need a long growth season.  Usually I do this too late for chillies and tomatoes, hence my lack of luck.  I think I am getting better at knowing when to plant stuff when.  It is a bit of a risk to start them off now, because of the lack of light more than anything.  The windowsills will provide good amounts of heat, but light will be limited.  I'm not going to supplement light; instead, I'll see what happens.

I'm trying a new tomato variety I haven't grown before: Costoluto Fiorentino.  It is a beefsteak, semi-determinate - which means it produces fruit up until the frosts but the main crop will ripen together.  I have tried to grow beef tomatoes in the past, I think I tried the year before last, but they didn't ripen very well.  I think I have found the sweet spot for sun in the garden, so I am hopeful this year will finally be successful.

The remaining garlic and onion bulbs in the greenhouse started to sprout, so I've stuck them into some pots and hope for the best.  I got some more onion sets: silvermoon.  We'll hopefully have a huge allium bumper harvest in 2019.  Again, I usually plant these too late, so I think I've cracked this one this year.  


I have replanted my trees into large pots as well, which was a beast of a task in the cold and rain.  I moved them into 44cm diameter pots, so they should be happier.

I also put another greenhouse, inside the main greenhouse, for additional shelving purposes.  I thought it was going to be pretty rubbish, but it wasn't bad for Â£10.

Liv has also built me another planter.  Just 2 more to go and I can plan what I'm growing!  I bought some perlite too, because I hate compost gnats so I can keep the plants inside, fly free before I put them outside.  This is to keep the chillies and tomtatoes happy.  Perlite is good for water retention, but doesn't contain nutrients, so they will need feeding.


That's all folks.
