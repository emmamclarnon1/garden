<p>The plants in the greenhouse are growing now. It’s still quite chilly here, but I’m hoping it will heat up soon.</p>
<p>I’ve sown more seeds for the garlic chives because the ones I sowed a couple of weeks ago have not germinated. The old g. chives were from Poundworld and I’ve never been able to germinate them before. I’ve ordered a new batch from www.seekay.co.uk for 99p. I will update the status on their growth as time goes on. I usually get seeds from seekay or <a href="https://www.premierseedsdirect.com/" class="uri">https://www.premierseedsdirect.com/</a> or Poundland/ Poundworld.</p>
<p>I’ve also decided to give hamburg parsley another shot this year. I tried last year, but I over-sowed too many brassica seeds beside them and they died due to lack of light. I’ve sown these seeds into a pot in the greenhouse and they require light for germination. Some seeds have started germinating already. They grow into parsley ontop and a parsnip-like root.</p>
<p>I’ve also sown some alpine strawberries - I grew them a few years ago into a hanging basket and they were delicious but were attacked by aphids. I didn’t grow them last year, but fancy trying them again this year. I’ve read they are perennial so I will put them into the ground, maybe where the herbs are at the front of the house.</p>
<p>I bought 6 chili plants today from B &amp; Q: I didn’t get around to germinating the seed in Jan and after many failed attempted recently, I figured there would be no point in growing from seed since it’s now May. I got 2 x Jalapeno, 2 x paper lantern chillies and 2 x Thai red dragon chili plants. Some already have some flower buds so I will try to keep them over winter if they survive because they actually are perennials, but seem to be grown as annuals in the UK due to the cold tempertures.</p>

<h3>Chili seed experiement</h3>
<p>I’ve started my chili seed experiment on the best germination technique. I’ve read that sanding seed coats or nicking a bit off the seed coat (scarification) speeds up germination, and I’ve had success previously with courgette seeds. I haven’t ever tested which method is best: soaking seeds, sanding or or nicking the coats. So I’ve set up an experiment to test this:</p>

<p>I’ve put 3 x Thai chili seeds in each treatment and also 2 x patio chillies for each treatment (I didn’t have 9 for patio chilleis, hence doing Thai chillies too). I’ve put each ramekin in a clear plastic bag to maintain heat and humidity levels.</p>
