I'm back!  It's been a while since I've had time to blog.  I've been very busy with the garden - and we also went on holiday to Vietnam, where mangos, jack fruit, kumquats and pomegranate are grown there with relative ease.  Puts my garden to shame!

Summer has finally started!  It hasn't rained very much in the last two months, so I have been very busy watering the garden.  The beds remain very dry and we have had a few casualties along the way. 

###Successes

We'll start with the good things to keep up morale!

####Courgettes & squash

I germinated a couple of different varieties of courgettes this summer - yellow skinned ones, green skinned (I think these were black beauty - I've gone a bit rogue with recording the varieties again) and a round variety (eight ball).  I also sowed a few squash seeds and by the looks o things, the Tromboncino seeds have survived:

The picture shows very a very immature female fruit growing, with any luck the male flowers and female flowers will open soon and they will grow well.  I had great success with these last year.  They do grow **huge** though, because they throw out tendrils and tend to climb, so if you have a small space try growing in a grow bag against a wall with a trellis.  I also have a few other random squash plants that I planted and cleverly didn't label.  All part of the excitement, right? I've also harvested my first courgette of the season.  A beautiful yellow beast.  I was going to let it grow really big, like I did last year with some, but I thought I'd leave it until we've had a few before I play with growing monster veg again.

####Peas and beans
I have had great success with all the types of peas and beans.  Lots of yummy pods to munch on.  I tend to snack on these when I'm out watering the plants.  I'm not sure I gave them all enough space though, or maybe the beds aren't quite right for them.  I thought by growing them near the edges where the netting was would help, but they seem a bit crowded there.  The petit pois didn't grow as well as I had hoped, but I think the blistering heat and the lack of rain has dried a good few of the legumes out.  The purple shiraz mange tout have been very good crop-wise again and the purple French beans!  They have been great crop-wise and the look lovely!

####Berries & currants

They grew *berry* well.  Sorry, couldn't help myself.  A few blackcurrants survived!  I finally got to try the elusive black currant, fresh from the horse's bush...(?) It was delicious.  Very like eating solid Ribena.  The gooseberries finally ripened too and I got a fairly decent crop considering how small the plant is.  We also kept running it over with the lawnmower/ tripping over it the first year by accident (a couple of others didn't survive the abuse).

The kiwis that have cropped seem to do surviving too, but they aren't getting any bigger.  I am feeding them, but they remain small.  I am very impatient too, so they may get bigger.  They should grow to roughly cherry sized berries, but are currently the size of my little toe nail.

####Others

I also harvesting my radishes and finally some turnips.  I did it!  I finally grew them.  There were several larva of something in a couple of them but, I'm taking it as a success.  I do not use any pesticides so I expect some skitters will try to take advantage of this.

I also harvested the giant Bulgarian leeks, mostly because they were flowering (told you they were in the ground for ages!).  They grew super tall, check it out: (brush there for perspective)

Finally, I also harvested my chives when they were in flower and made some delicious pesto with them!  I wanted to catch them before they started dying off and seeding all over the show again. I'll put a separate post up about how to do the pesto, but it was freakin' good!  Think cheese and onion, but with pasta. Tasty.

Right, that's all from me for now!  I'll be back soon with the recipe for the pesto and more gardening fun.
