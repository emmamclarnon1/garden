In my last blog post, I promised a recipe for chive pesto.  I stumbled across the recipe when I was searching for what to do with a large amount of chives; most of the suggestions were “sprinkle on soups” or “use in an omelette”.  There’s only so many omelettes and soups a person can have before they go off.  Plus, I wanted to make chives the main feature – not have it as something thrown in at the end.  I found this recipe online (http://www.agardenforthehouse.com/2013/05/chive-pesto/) and thought it sounded great.   This recipe makes about 3 small round containers (see picture).   I’ve adapted the recipe  ever so slightly, so here is my version:


###Equipment


- Food processor with knife blade\n
- Fine grater (for hard cheese) \n
- Measuring jug\n
- Tubs with lids for pesto \n
- Marker (for writing dates on lids)\n


###Ingredients 


- ~500 grams of chives (this was the total quantity my food processor would take)
- 120ml of extra virgin olive oil
- 100 grams of Parmesan cheese (grated)
- 2 garlic cloves
- 50 grams of almonds (chopped if possible) \n

###Method


1.	Add the chives to the food processor and turn on for about 2 mins
2.	Add the  garlic, cheese and almonds to the food processor – turn on and pour in the oil through the top as the mixture is being chopped
3.	Keep the food processor on for about another  3 – 5 mins.  The consistency will vary depending on how woody the chives are.  My chives were quite stiff because they had just flowered, but if you have fresh chives without flowers reduce the time.  
4.	Turn off when desired consistency is reached.

###Notes


I bought almonds that were not chopped and was too lazy to chop them, so I lolloped them in and hoped for the best.  This was not a good idea. The nuts weren’t chopped very finely by the food processor, so there were just massive chunks of almonds throughout.  It wasn’t a deal breaker, but more annoying.  My hand blender also broke the previous week, so if you have one I recommend using that if you buy whole almonds.
I froze the remaining tubs and gave some to family.  I was reluctant to put in the cheese to the batch to be frozen because I’ve read the cheese doesn’t freeze well, but Liv twisted my arm and I thought  I’d try it; I can always leave it out next time if the cheese goes weird.
Otherwise, enjoy!  It is a cheesy delight!
