<h2>2019 recap</h2>
<p>Hi all, it’s been a long time since I’ve blogged. I have been very busy with the allotment and garden :) It’s been a very productive year and I am loving my allotment!</p>
<p>In 2019 I successfully managed to grow loads of funny coloured potatoes, onions, cabbages, chillies, tomatilloes, asparagus, raspberries, strawberries and loads of other things that were all equally yummy. I grew way too many courgettes and broad beans! The glut was real; I’d never had a glut before, but now I will never grow too many courgette plants as the stress of trying to use them all is so stressful!</p>

<p>I had lots or raspberries, blackberries and other kinds of berries this year! Finally seeing the fruits of my labour - quite exciting. Though one minor concern is that the raspberries keep coming up through the lawn…</p>

<p>I grw pumpkins for the first time too (foot for scale). It was a the variety “Crown Prince” - silver/ blue skinned fruits. Very tasty too.</p>

<p>My courgette/ squash glut came from growing round courgettes, regular green courgettes (variety “black beauty”),red kuri and patty pan. All delicious; but I grew too many! I had about 4/ 5 times this amount!</p>

<p>I also grew some sweetheart cabbages, I had forgotten about them, but they just appeared and I was chuffed with myself:</p>

<h3>2019 Winter</h3>
<p>Currently I have sprouts (red and green), purple sprouting broccoli and leeks in the ground. I grew the sprouts too early and they have very loose leaves filled with slugs and all sorts. Lesson learned for next year!</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to getting rid of everything and starting again once I harvest my last potatoes and sprouts. The apple fir ones were bloody delicious I might add; the red fleshed ones made interesting mash and the purple rain ones are still in the ground as the asparagus is yet to fully die back so I can’t get to them!</p>
<p>I’m planning on having on soft fruit bed for all my raspberries, strawberries and other fruits. Then 2 for the rest of the food. I will plan everything better next year, honest!</p>
