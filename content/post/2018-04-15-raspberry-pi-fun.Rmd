Today I tried to set up my Pi and the DHT22 sensor.  It was all going to well in the beginning.  The stuff I ordered from eBay arrived really fast (see references section for supplier details) and I was bright eyed and bushy tailed this morning at 10am. 

###Problem number 1:  I have no idea about electronics

To elaborate, I tried to use a couple of really great tutorials I found online, to help set up the sensor and store the data in a mysql database.  Easy!  Follow the tutorial and it's done, right? Big fat "computer says no".  The set up I'm using consists of a breadboard because I can't solder.  I was following this for the setup (https://www.hackster.io/adamgarbo/raspberry-pi-2-iot-thingspeak-dht22-sensor-b208f4), but then I realised I only had male/ female jumper wires and you need 3 connector wires (or whatever they are called) - you could also use male/male jumper wires because they have pins both ends.  Anyhow, as I mentioned, I only had M/F ones.  Luckily, Liv is good with electronics (e.g. when I cut through the hedge trimmers, she can rewrite the things) so she stripped some extra cables and made some M/M wires.

Excellent.  Let's move on using the other tutorial (http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-PI-and-DHT22-temperature-and-humidity-lo/).

###Problem number 2: Static IP addresses

The second tutorial recommends that you set a static IP address for your Pi.  This means that when you try to link up a dataabase, the IP address for your Pi won't keep changing (as it is usually recycled by your router every two weeks or so).  I followed the instructions, but this only resulted in no internet.  After a **couple of hours** (I know, I shouldn't have wasted *that* much time, but how hard can it be to do, right?).  I reverted back to the original settings and decided that since my IP address hasn't changed yet, perhaps it won't - let's hope so.

###Problem number 3: mysql server

I've managed to hook up the DHT22 as per the tutorial and get a reading.  Success!  I'm going be be finished really soon.  WRONG!  I try to enter the fateful lines:

```r{eval=F}
sudo apt-get install mysql-server python-mysqldb
```

It's one line of code.  To install the mysql database.  How could this go wrong?  Well, I'll tell you:  after trying this failed, I did a quick search on the internet and it suggested I update all packages and upgrade them.  So I did and same error message.  Then I tried:

```r{eval=F}
sudo apt-get update --fix-missing
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

This seemed to do the trick.  Finally! The installation works.

Another problem appears:  the tutorial said I should be asked to set a root password.  I didn't get asked this.  How do I access the DB?  It keeps telling me access is denied for root@localhost.  I tried to reset it but no such luck.

I have to uninstall mysql and reinstall it to get it working.  No idea what went wrong, or what I did.

To remove it:
```r{eval=F}
sudo pkill mysql
sudo pkill mariadb
sudo apt-get remove --purge mysql\*
sudo apt-get remove --purge mariadb\*
```

Then run:
```r{eval=F}
sudo apt-get install mysql-server python-mysqldb
```

This nicely brings me back to about 2 hours ago... I've managed to find a good article to help (https://askubuntu.com/questions/931001/problem-with-mysql-root-password).  Now, I had done this before, but when I typed in: 
```r{eval=F}
mysql
```
I got an error message about pi@localhost being denied permission.  Turns out, I was doing it wrong.  You need to type in:

```r{eval=T}
mysql -u root -p -h localhost
```
You'll see the message that 1 row was affected, this mean the password was successfully changed.  Pretty sure I didn't get 1 row changed before, which is why I didn't think it had worked.


After yet more hours, it still doesn't seem to work.  It turns out, (https://askubuntu.com/questions/766900/mysql-doesnt-ask-for-root-password-when-installing/766908#766908) you can just get root access via: 

```r{}
sudo mysql -u root -p -h localhost
```
and it doesn't matter if you don't enter any password.  You can still change it (see article) but I've decided against it as I have little time left today and I've managed to create the logger account without any issues.

Onwards!

Having followed said instructions and tested out the DHT22, it successfully logs the data every 5 minutes.  **Note** the script DHT22logger.py needed adjusting as I only had one sensor.  I commented all the lines with sensor2 (using #) and it worked.  I also had to remove all sensor 2 info from the json file too.

A 5 minute collection of data is too frequent, I've changed the 5 to 60 (hourly instead of 5 mins).

On to LAMP installation (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP).  **Note** the tutorial installation didn't work for me.  I've setup LAMP before on a different Pi, so I was able to navigate to this site: (https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lamp-web-server-with-wordpress/3) which I know works. Follow the installation for the Apache, MySQL and the PHP.  Ignore the rest. 

Next! (Yes, I am feeling smug - but 9 hours in and I'm not sure how worth it this really is).

Okay - I can't get the DDNS part to work.  I give up.  It still should work on the local IP address using the index.php file.  I'm calling it a day, not entirely sure it was successful!

Until tomorrow.  I may end up using the API from the first tutorial.  I'll dig some more.
