  <p>I’m back! It’s been a while since I’ve had time to blog. I’ve been very busy with the garden - and we also went on holiday to Vietnam, where mangos, jack fruit, kumquats and pomegranate are grown there with relative ease. Puts my garden to shame!</p>
<p>Summer has finally started! It hasn’t rained very much in the last two months, so I have been very busy watering the garden. The beds remain very dry and we have had a few casualties along the way.</p>
<div id="successes" class="section level3">
<h3>Successes</h3>
<p>We’ll start with the good things to keep up morale!</p>
<div id="courgettes-squash" class="section level4">
<h4>Courgettes &amp; squash</h4>
<p>I germinated a couple of different varieties of courgettes this summer - yellow skinned ones, green skinned (I think these were black beauty - I’ve gone a bit rogue with recording the varieties again) and a round variety (eight ball). I also sowed a few squash seeds and by the looks o things, the Tromboncino seeds have survived:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/images/11.08.18-110.jpg" alt="Trombone squash" />
<p class="caption">Trombone squash</p>
</div>
<p>The picture shows very a very immature female fruit growing, with any luck the male flowers and female flowers will open soon and they will grow well. I had great success with these last year. They do grow <strong>huge</strong> though, because they throw out tendrils and tend to climb, so if you have a small space try growing in a grow bag against a wall with a trellis. I also have a few other random squash plants that I planted and cleverly didn’t label. All part of the excitement, right? I’ve also harvested my first courgette of the season. A beautiful yellow beast. I was going to let it grow really big, like I did last year with some, but I thought I’d leave it until we’ve had a few before I play with growing monster veg again.</p>

<div id="peas-and-beans" class="section level4">
<h4>Peas and beans</h4>
<p>I have had great success with all the types of peas and beans. Lots of yummy pods to munch on. I tend to snack on these when I’m out watering the plants. I’m not sure I gave them all enough space though, or maybe the beds aren’t quite right for them. I thought by growing them near the edges where the netting was would help, but they seem a bit crowded there. The petit pois didn’t grow as well as I had hoped, but I think the blistering heat and the lack of rain has dried a good few of the legumes out. The purple shiraz mange tout have been very good crop-wise again and the purple French beans! They have been great crop-wise and the look lovely!</p>

<div id="berries-currants" class="section level4">
<h4>Berries &amp; currants</h4>
<p>They grew <em>berry</em> well. Sorry, couldn’t help myself. A few blackcurrants survived! I finally got to try the elusive black currant, fresh from the horse’s bush…(?) It was delicious. Very like eating solid Ribena. The gooseberries finally ripened too and I got a fairly decent crop considering how small the plant is. We also kept running it over with the lawnmower/ tripping over it the first year by accident (a couple of others didn’t survive the abuse).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/images/11.08.18-13.jpg" alt="Gooseberries" />
<p class="caption">Gooseberries</p>
</div>
<p>The kiwis that have cropped seem to do surviving too, but they aren’t getting any bigger. I am feeding them, but they remain small. I am very impatient too, so they may get bigger. They should grow to roughly cherry sized berries, but are currently the size of my little toe nail.</p>

<div id="others" class="section level4">
<h4>Others</h4>
<p>I also harvesting my radishes and finally some turnips. I did it! I finally grew them. There were several larva of something in a couple of them but, I’m taking it as a success. I do not use any pesticides so I expect some skitters will try to take advantage of this.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Turnip</p>
</div>
<p>I also harvested the giant Bulgarian leeks, mostly because they were flowering (told you they were in the ground for ages!). They grew super tall, check it out: (brush there for perspective)</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Leeks</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, I also harvested my chives when they were in flower and made some delicious pesto with them! I wanted to catch them before they started dying off and seeding all over the show again. I’ll put a separate post up about how to do the pesto, but it was freakin’ good! Think cheese and onion, but with pasta. Tasty.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Right, that’s all from me for now! I’ll be back soon with the recipe for the pesto and more gardening fun.</p>
