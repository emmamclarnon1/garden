  <p>Minimum temperatures are rising and seeds are germinating. This is the time of year I really look forward to; I can plan what I will grow, and then watch it slowly turn from my imagination into reality. Well, some sort of reality. Usually not quite how I’d planned. But still, exciting times are ahead.</p>
<div id="allotment" class="section level3">
<h3>Allotment</h3>
<p>I spent this weekend planting up the garlic and onion sets that I’d started off in the greenhouse, at the allotment. I got 3 rows of garlic and 3 rows of onions. I put 2 mini mesh polytunnels (3m long by 50cm wide each) over them, so the birds wouldn’t pick them out. I can then reuse these for other seedlings. I had quite a few spare bulbs from the onion sets, they give so many, so I thought I’d plant them out in the raised beds in the garden.</p>
<p>If they all grow well, then we’ll end with with a crazy amount of onions and garlic. But what usually happens is that slugs attack or else the bulbs rot. I’m feeling confident that those which I’ve started in the greenhouse will be fine though.</p>

<h3>Home</h3>
<p>The greenhouse gets quite warm in the sunshine, clocking up temperatures of over 30 degrees when the sun is on. So I’ve made a bold decision and moved some of the seeds I was growing up inside the house (in messy perlite hell), to the greenhouse. The leeks and cabbage seeds mostly. They were in okay shape, but the perlite wasn’t great for them. I’ve also sown more seeds in the greenhouse, with a half and half mix of perlite and compost. The only seeds that I think will be okay to start off now: carrot 2 purple varieties, peas (petite pois, shiraz and greenshaft), Brussel sprouts, Romanseco cauliflower and some long scarlet radish. I transplanted the leek and cabbage seedlings to bigger pots of compost, and will keep doing so until they need to go outside.</p>
<p>As well as planting the sets into the raised beds, I gave the raised beds a bit of TLC. I found some random carrots and onions growing from last year. There was a mini purple haze carrot and a couple of beastly onions. I know that onions are biennels, so I assume they will flower. I don’t actually remember planting them, but I’m sure I tried to grow some last year - Sturton variety. This was when I had my onion epiphany. I realised that sets just grew bigger. I was expecting them to divide and produce more. Of course they will now (bulbs tend to after 2 years), but the aim of them is to just grow bigger. And yes, I have a PhD… I know. I’m ashamed. Haha. I believe the word is “duh!”.</p>
<p>I also put the hazelnut/cob trees into the garden. I had bought those big old pots. But jeepers they are difficult to fill with compost, being a whopping 55cm in diameter. Instead I decided to plant the trees in the ground and keep them in a bushy form. This means the roots will be less restricted than in a pot. They grow vigorously and I was concerned that they’d run out of space too quickly.</p>
<p>I moved the jostaberry to the front, though it has yet to provide any fruit. It was destroyed by insects last year: caterpillars found it too delicious.</p>
<p>I repotted the Chilean guava into one of the 55cm pots, and a good thing it was too; it was quite pit bound.</p>
<p>I took some softwood cuttings of Chilean guava, bay, sage and rosemary at the end of the autumn and kept them in pots. Surprisingly some of them are still going and have sprouted some roots. I have transferred them to individual pots, but I’m hoping they grow and take. I didn’t use rooting power, but I’m hoping that when they start to grow the roots will develop anyway. There’s debate about the benefits of rooting powder and how effective it actually is. I’ve personally never used it and have been able to grow sage and rosemary from cuttings before, so we’ll see!</p>
<p>Onwards, to the great epiphany of 2019!</p>
