<h3>Allotment news</h3>
<p>It’s official: I am now renting an allotment! I went for a look on Saturday and was told a quarter plot was rough 8 x 8 m2. I also had a choice, which was nice. Plot was chosen: I was tempted to take the plot with lots of raspberry canes, but decided against it because there was more work than the other one.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of the plot!</p>

</div>
<p>The people who had been renting it before ran the whole of the allotments, so it’s in pretty good nick. They have erected some raised beds and it looks like the compost is healthy and fresh. I’ve landed pretty well on my feet, I have to say! The beds need a bit of TLC as some of the planks of wood are missing, but I have some sleepers at home that Liv is going to help me move and attach.</p>
<p>I’ve always held off on applying for an allotment because anecdotally it takes years to get on the waiting list. I think it took me 10 days between my first email and being allocated one, so all-in-all a very short waiting time indeed.</p>
<p>Now I have a huge space, I can grow some things at home that are small and easy to pick and keep the allotment for the bigger beasts, such as potatoes, cabbages, cauliflower, courgette, multiple squash varieties, kohl robi etc. Basically, all the things that I always run out of space for here that end up shading and killing the remainder of my veg.</p>
<p>I had an interesting conversation about the use of slug pellets with the guy at the allotments. I personally don’t use any pest control (other than biological). I understand why people want to use them, and I’ve had my fair share of battles with slugs and aphids etc, but I feel a bit mean. I’m happy to use my garlic spay, slap on the silicon to help them grow extra spikey trichomes (hair like structures that can be filled with silica), try adding aspirin and jasmine tea to boost their natural plant defences (salyscilic acid from aspirin and jasmonic acid from jasmine tea form the basis of the plant’s defence system - i.e. their immune system) and see what happens. I feel that I won last year between Emma (well, the blackcurrant) and the whitefly with my chilli, garlic, aspirin spray. If I have to resort to other methods, I will. But first, I have bought some ultra fine mesh to stop the little scamps from entering. Goodbye cabbage white eggs, pea moths, various root grubs. Hello tranquil plants.</p>

<h3>Planty business</h3>
<p>Liv has got several new jobs now, bless her. She’s always getting roped in by association: I know what I need building and she can make it. She’s made me a huge planter that is going outside the front and I will have a couple more of those. I have promised to put flowers in them, but they will be edible (obviously).</p>

<p>I started off some seed indoors last night too: some broadbeans, leeks (lyon and Bulgarian giant), spring onions (New Holland Bloodred), cabbage and cauliflower.</p>

<p>I’ve also been to the allotment (on Sunday) and had a mini clear of some of the weeds. It was freezing so I didn’t spend long there.</p>

<p>…Small steps…</p>
<p>In other news, my potatoes arrived! I need to start chitting them, then I’ll move them into a grow bag in the greenhouse for a bit, because it’s gone quite chilly and then I’ll zip them over to the allotment.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-stuff" class="section level3">
<h3>R stuff</h3>
<p>So I’ve been thinking about the best way to keep an eye on things that need to be sown, planted out, harvested etc. I was initially going to build a Shiny dashboard, but I can’t host it on this site as it is a static site. Instead, I’m going to try and build a database and then call on it to display the latest data when I update it. I am most familiar with Postgres SQL, but I may utilisae a non-SQL db like monogoDB or Aparche Spark. I’ll have to investigate this further in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>That’s enough excited from me, I’ll be back soon with some more plant-related action.</p>
