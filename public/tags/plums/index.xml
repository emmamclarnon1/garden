      <description>I’m back! It’s been a while since I’ve had time to blog. I’ve been very busy with the garden - and we also went on holiday to Vietnam where mangos, jack fruit, kumquats and pomegranate are grown there with relative ease. It puts my garden to shame!
Summer has finally started! It hasn’t rained very much in the last two months, so I have been very busy watering the garden. The beds remain very dry and we have had a few casualties along the way.</description>
