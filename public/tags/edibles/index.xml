      <description>Sunshine at last! The UK has finally remembered it is spring! I celebrated by pressure washing the garden paths. Very rock and roll. I also did an inspection of the plants to see how they were getting on.
TreesBoth nectarine (varierty Harco) and the plum tree are in full flower. The plum tree is in its third spring now. I bought 5 dwarf fruit trees (2x apple - gala and golden delicious, 1 cherry - Stella, 1 plum - Stanley and 1 pear) in the first winter of moving here.</description>

      <description>More Pi funSo after yesterday’s massive fail, I decided to go with (https://www.hackster.io/adamgarbo/raspberry-pi-2-iot-thingspeak-dht22-sensor-b208f4). It took me around 5 minutes to set up. Boo! I wanted to use the other one because I was interested in the MySQL side of things. Therefore, this is a temporary measure and I will do my own programming to get it working. I’ve been working on a similar project in work to collect data, store it in a DB and write it to the php script so I will have to rememeber how to do that.</description>

      <description>Today I tried to set up my Pi and the DHT22 sensor. It was all going to well in the beginning. The stuff I ordered from eBay arrived really fast (see references section for supplier details) and I was bright eyed and bushy tailed this morning at 10am.
Problem number 1: I have no idea about electronicsTo elaborate, I tried to use a couple of really great tutorials I found online, to help set up the sensor and store the data in a mysql database.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my first post! I am very pleased to have come this far. I have to admit, I’m not really sure I know what I’m doing with blogdown! Disclaimer alert if any links on the site don’t work, please leave me a comment and I’ll try to fix them.
Today I’m planning on deploying the site using Netlify because that’s what I’ve read on a couple of other blogs (https://alison.</description>
