      <description>Today I purchased two small plants (around 9cm of so) of the Kiwi variety Issai. I also bought this a couple of years ago in a 2 litre pot from Suttons, but I spied these plants in Morrisons for £2 each and couldn’t resist - some even have flower buds, but it is good practice to pick these out and leave them to focus their energy on growth. I bought a lemon balm plant pot, which I’m going to separate out and put in my herb patch and in some pots around the house.</description>
