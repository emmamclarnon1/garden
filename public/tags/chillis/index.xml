      <description>Hello from sunny Leeds! Yes, more sunshine has been sent. Today has been really warm and the bank holiday weather was good for the plants.
Note: I compress the images for the web, but I’ve noticed the quality is pretty naff and they go all blurred. Will look into improving these in the future.
To begin, I will start with the ongoing experiment. The conclusion is: chilli seeds do not like to germinate!</description>

      <description>The plants in the greenhouse are growing now. It’s still quite chilly here, but I’m hoping it will heat up soon.
I’ve sown more seeds for the garlic chives because the ones I sowed a couple of weeks ago have not germinated. The old g. chives were from Poundworld and I’ve never been able to germinate them before. I’ve ordered a new batch from www.seekay.co.uk for 99p. I will update the status on their growth as time goes on.</description>
