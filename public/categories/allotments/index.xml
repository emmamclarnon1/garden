      <description>2019 recapHi all, it’s been a long time since I’ve blogged. I have been very busy with the allotment and garden :) It’s been a very productive year and I am loving my allotment!
In 2019 I successfully managed to grow loads of funny coloured potatoes, onions, cabbages, chillies, tomatilloes, asparagus, raspberries, strawberries and loads of other things that were all equally yummy. I grew way too many courgettes and broad beans!</description>

      <description>Allotment newsIt’s official: I am now renting an allotment! I went for a look on Saturday and was told a quarter plot was rough 8 x 8 m2. I also had a choice, which was nice. Plot was chosen: I was tempted to take the plot with lots of raspberry canes, but decided against it because there was more work than the other one.
Here are some pictures of the plot!</description>
