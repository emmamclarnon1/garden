      <description>More Pi funSo after yesterday’s massive fail, I decided to go with (https://www.hackster.io/adamgarbo/raspberry-pi-2-iot-thingspeak-dht22-sensor-b208f4). It took me around 5 minutes to set up. Boo! I wanted to use the other one because I was interested int he MySQL side of things. Therefore, this is a temporary measure and I will do my own programming to get it working. I’ve been working on a similar project in work to collect data, store it in a DB and write it to the php script so I will have to rememeber how to do that.</description>

      <description>Today I tried to set up my Pi and the DHT22 sensor. It was all going to well in the beginning. The stuff I ordered from eBay arrived really fast (see references section for supplier details) and I was bright eyed and bushy tailed this morning at 10am.
Problem number 1: I have no idea about electronicsTo elaborate, I tried to use a couple of really great tutorials I found online, to help set up the sensor and store the data in a mysql database.</description>
