    Minimum temperatures are rising and seeds are germinating. This is the time of year I really look forward to; I can plan what I will grow, and then watch it slowly turn from my imagination into reality. Well, some sort of reality. Usually not quite how I’d planned. But still, exciting times are ahead.
AllotmentI spent this weekend planting up the garlic and onion sets that I’d started off in the greenhouse, at the allotment.

    Hello. It’s been quite frosty recently, so I’ve been sowing seeds inside and making a complete mess with perlite.
A few years ago, we had a terrible infestation with compost gnats when I reported a dragon tree, so I wanted to avoid that again this year. My bright idea was to buy loads of perlite and start the chillies and tomatoes off inside. I used this during my PhD very briefly and it was grand.

    Allotment newsI’ve been up to the allotment this weekend and managed to clear away most of the remaining plants left by the previous owner. I now have a mostly cleared plot. Just some more weeding to do before it is totally clear, but I hoed all of the beds, so I’m hoping the frost will nip them dead so I don’t have to. There are some Calendula (AKA English marigold) there, which I intend to keep.

    Allotment newsIt’s official: I am now renting an allotment! I went for a look on Saturday and was told a quarter plot was rough 8 x 8 m2. I also had a choice, which was nice. Plot was chosen: I was tempted to take the plot with lots of raspberry canes, but decided against it because there was more work than the other one.
Here are some pictures of the plot!

    PlansI’ve been beavering away at getting plants sorted and making plans for this year. I’ve already ordered some seed potatoes online (patchseedpotatoes.co.uk), from the motherland (N. Ireland). I’m quite excited because they are unusual varieties: - purple rain: second early. It has purple skin and flesh. I tried similar from Lidl last year and they were delicious and weird looking on the plate.
Purple Rain: image from https://www.patchseedpotatoes.co.uk/product/purple-rain-seed-potatoes/
Highland Burgundy red: this potato has red flesh, hailing from Scotland.

    So I’m back - I have been altogether rubbish at keeping it updated in the summer. Too much fun was had between entering a new decade of my life, graduating (finally, I can use my Dr title and revive all those dying plants) and drinking lots of beer. There was also some gardening too.
I finally made some wins in the garden: I successfully grew cucamelons and chillies! I know I didn’t grow the chillies from seed, but I’m taking it as a massive win!

    In my last blog post, I promised a recipe for chive pesto. I stumbled across the recipe when I was searching for what to do with a large amount of chives; most of the suggestions were “sprinkle on soups” or “use in an omelette”. There’s only so many omelettes and soups a person can have before they go off. Plus, I wanted to make chives the main feature – not have it as something thrown in at the end.

    I’m back! It’s been a while since I’ve had time to blog. I’ve been very busy with the garden - and we also went on holiday to Vietnam where mangos, jack fruit, kumquats and pomegranate are grown there with relative ease. It puts my garden to shame!
Summer has finally started! It hasn’t rained very much in the last two months, so I have been very busy watering the garden. The beds remain very dry and we have had a few casualties along the way.

    Hi again - quick update on things so far. The weather is still very warm and sunny, so everything is finally catching up with the cold start to spring. That said, it has only rained twice in almost four weeks. Things are very dry!
I had to get the hose out and water the raised beds because I noticed that the flowers from the broadbeans were just dropping off and no pods were setting.

    Google AnalyticsI’ve been working on trying to integrate Google Analytics into this blog, so I can see how many people are actually reading it. Easy, right? HA! It should have worked fine, but as with everything, I had a bit of a nightmare. So the workflow is basically: set up a GA account, paste in the tracking code into your blogdown config.toml file (if your theme has this feature built in - and the one I’m using does) and it should work.
