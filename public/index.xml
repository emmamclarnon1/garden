      <description>Welcome to my gardening blog! I am writing this blog to document my experiments with growing fruit and vegetables in my garden. I completed my PhD in September 2017 and I am keen to nurture my love of plants! I have been growing edibles for around 4 years. I bought a house in 2015 with my partner and since then I&amp;rsquo;vee been transforming the garden into one big edible garden. The vision is to have as many plants as possible that are edible in the garden.</description>
