Welcome to my gardening blog!  I am writing this blog to document my experiments with growing fruit and vegetables in my garden.  I completed my PhD in September 2017 and I want to continue  nurturing my love of plants!  I have been growing edibles for around 4 years, but have loved plants for a long time. I had the pleasure of doing a placement year at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (2010 - 2011) when I was studying for my BSc. and helped to develop this website and electronic key (http://malpighiales.myspecies.info/).  

I bought a house in 2015 with my partner and since then I've been transforming the garden into one big edible garden.  The vision is to have as many edible plants as possible in the garden - this quite often leads to me digging up areas of grass to make space for growing beds.  I've experimented with growing what have been described as "unusual" varieties, and this year I want to start documenting my successes (and failures).  I also have a small greenhouse where I repeatedly fail to grow chillis and tomatoes.  I have noticed that it gets very hot in the summer ( >40 C), so I have bought a temperature and humidity sensor and I'm going to track the change in temperature over the day and the summer months to see how high it really gets.

I hope you enjoy reading this blog!
